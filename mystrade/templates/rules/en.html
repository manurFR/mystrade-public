        <h2>Etiquette</h2>

        <p>The following rules of conduct must be respected at all times. Should you break them, your account may be suspended or deleted.</p>
        <p>Those items are big NO-NOs that have been identified. They are <em>not</em> comprehensive, and new ones will be added as needed.
            If your case is not specified in the list, ask yourself if it respects the <em>Zen of MysTrade</em>:
            <div id="idea"><strong>Be a respectful human being and don't spoil the fun of others.</strong></div>
            If there's still a doubt, <a href="&#109;ailto&#58;hello&#64;mystra&#46;de">ask the administrator</a>.</p>

        <h3>Rules of conduct</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Insults.</strong> Do not post any racist, sexist, antisemitic, homophobic, transphobic, derogatory, defamatory or insulting words.
                No religion, no politics. If you need to express criticism, do it in the most constructing and caring fashion.
                All of this is applicable both to public and to private exchanges.</li>
            <li><strong>Impatience.</strong> Do not publicly criticize people for refusing to interact with you, or being slow to do so. They may have good
                reasons, either in game or in real life.<br>
                What you can do: i) cancel the trade; ii) contact the person in private (see previous rule then);
                iii) contact the <a href="&#109;ailto&#58;hello&#64;mystra&#46;de">administrator</a>.<br>
                Conversely, always respond to in-game requests as quickly as you can (even if just to decline them).</li>
            <li><strong>Rule Cards.</strong> Do not include the text of a rule card (in full or even in part) in a public post. It breaks the spirit of the game.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Mystrade Rules</h2>

    <div class="image_right"><img src="{% static 'propaganda/animals_commodities.png' %}" alt="screenshot of a player's hand with commodities" width="240"/></div>

    <h3>Objective</h3>

    <p>At the beginning of a game, each player gets a random hand of cards, from two categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ten Commodity cards, of variable worth;</li>
        <li>Two Rule cards (out of a larger set, defined by the game master).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The objective is to have, at the end of the game, the most valuable combination of <strong>commodity</strong> cards.
    The catch is that players know only a part of the rules at the start, but their points will be computed from the whole set of rules available in
    the game !</p>

    <p>The number of rules used in a game is initially secret, but each rule is identified by a number, and at least two copies of each are dealt randomly
    to all players at the start of the game.</p>

    <h3>Trades</h3>

    <p>Trades of cards are the way by which players seek to fulfill their two objectives: learning the content of as many <strong>rule</strong> cards as
    possible, and gathering the most valuable set of <strong>commodity</strong> cards. Each player involved in a tentative trade submits to the other an
    offer including as many cards (commodities and/or rules), and as many &laquo; free informations &raquo;, as wished. Any kind of deal is permitted,
    as long as it satisfies both players; the number of trades occuring during a game is not limited.</p>

    <div class="image_left"><img src="{% static 'propaganda/animals_trade.png' %}" alt="screenshot of a trade proposal" width="300"/></div>

    <p>As long as a trade has not been accepted by both players, they can only see from each other's offer:
        <ul style="overflow: hidden;">
            <li>the list of commodities,</li>
            <li>the <em>number</em> of the offered rules,</li>
            <li>and whether a free information has been provided or not.</li>
        </ul>
    The <em>full text</em> of the rules and of the free information will be  revealed only once both players have accepted the other one's offer.<br/>
    A player can always add a comment to the submitted offer, and that piece of text will be immediately visible by the other player. Such a comment could
    clarify the subject of the hidden elements of the offer, and/or specify what is expected back for it, etc.</p>

    <h3>End of the Game</h3>

    <p>Every game is created with a start date and an end date. When the end date is reached, no trades can be performed anymore,
    even those which were already initiated but not accepted by both players: they will be cancelled.
    Using the commodity cards each player has handed in, the scores are computed when the game master decides to do so.</p>

    <p>A player can hand in a set of commodities excluding some owned cards if it is believed that this will make the hand
    more valuable. The players must choose to do this <strong>before the game's end date</strong> ; those who won't opt to do it
    before that date will automatically hand in <em>all</em> their commodity cards.</p>

    <h3>Rules Example</h3>

    <p>Each player knows only some of these cards at the start of the game.</p>
