        At this moment, <strong>all</strong> your commodity cards will automatically be submitted back to the game master for scoring.<br/>
        You can leave this page now if you are fine with this procedure.<br/>
        <br/>
        Alternatively, you may submit only <em>some</em> of your commodity cards <strong>and</strong> finish your game now. Select those cards below.<br/>
        Please note that, if you do, you will not be able to propose or respond to any trade until the actual end of the game.
